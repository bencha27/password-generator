# Password Generator

Password Generator is a basic application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

## Usage

Click on the "Generate Password" button. Follow the prompts to choose your preferences for the password:

- Number of characters (between 8â€“128)
- Lowercase letters
- Uppercase letters
- Numbers
- Special characters

After you respond to all the prompts, your randomly generated password will be displayed on the page.

### Note:

- To generate a new/different password, you must start over.
- If you do not properly select the criteria (e.g., number of characters, none of the character types chosen), a password will not be generated.
